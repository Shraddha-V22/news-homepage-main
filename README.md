## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Continued development

I am not really able to make it fully responsive. It is looking good for more tan 1440px screen and less than 800px screen but between the two the elements overlap. I will improve that and will focus on getting that right.
